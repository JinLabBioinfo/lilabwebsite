I am a PhD student who joined the Yan lab in 2021, where I have been engaged in exploring fundamental biological roles of pancreatic β cells within diabetes disease progression. My research focuses on both intra- and inter-cellular mechanisms that underpin β cell functionality. At the intracellular level, I study mitochondrial complexes and their contributions to β cell health, while my inter-cellular research examines cross-communication between β cells and other pancreatic cell types, aiming to uncover pathways that influence β cell behavior and disease outcomes.
