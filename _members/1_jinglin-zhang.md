My research focus is diabetic diseases. I work on Î²-cell differentiation and aim to characterize the transcriptional regulation during differentiation using single-cell multiomic analysis. I also focus on the molecular features of islet cell types using spatial transcriptomes, and seek novel therapeutic targets for diabetes treatments.
