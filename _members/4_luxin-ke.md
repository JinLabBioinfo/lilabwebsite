As a PhD student in Genetics and Genome Sciences, I focus on genetics
and developmental biology. My research explores the genetic mechanisms
that shape human β cell development, incorporating extensive cell
culture, β cell differentiation protocols, and single-cell
technologies to advance our understanding in this field. I’m driven by
a genuine interest in uncovering new insights that contribute to our
understanding of these complex processes. Outside the lab, I enjoy
cooking, traveling, and playing music—activities that bring fresh
perspectives and creativity to my work.
