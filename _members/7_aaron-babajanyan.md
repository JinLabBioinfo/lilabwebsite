I am an undergraduate student at CWRU studying Biochemistry and Economics on the Pre-Health track. I am fascinated by clinically translational research, and specifically, how genetic therapy can be employed to improve disease health outcomes. In the past, I have studied the mechanisms of endothelial release of von Willebrand factor and the biogenesis of Weibel-Palade bodies for applications of VWD genetic therapy. Currently, I am working with Jasmine Liu and Dr. Yan Li to examine the communication between human Î² cells and the pancreatic stellate cell, aiming to uncover pathways that may contribute to future clinical interventions for diabetes mellitus.
